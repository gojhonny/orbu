# Rule 001: Package contract

- Effective: 2026-08-21
- Updated: 2026-09-24
- Priority: Critical
- Applies: Always

1. `orbo-voice` is a library, not an application or monorepo.
2. Keep the package framework-agnostic and SSR-safe.
3. Keep `<orb-o>` as the only runtime UI implementation.
4. `orbo-voice/browser` owns registration side effects.
5. `react-types` is type-only and must not add a React runtime dependency.
6. Provider secrets belong to consuming applications.
7. Intentional npm payload is limited to `dist/`, the shell-only `cli/`, and npm root metadata.
8. Do not publish source maps.
9. Treat every public export, attribute, property, method, event, and entry point as a compatibility commitment.
10. Documentation sites and framework examples live outside this repository.
11. npm identity and GitHub ownership are independent: publish `orbo-voice`
    from `jonatassales/orbo`. The product, CLI, element, and public API are Orbo,
    `orbo`, `<orb-o>`, and `Orbo*` (ADR-0025 and SPEC-034). The npm name is a
    distribution concern. Do not keep `orb-voice`, `<orb-voice>`, the
    `orb-voice` binary, `@neongate-ai/orbz`, `<orb-z>`, the `orb` binary,
    `orbu`, or `<orb-u>` as current aliases.
12. Preset branding is independent of npm and GitHub ownership. Keep NeonGate's
    canonical identifier `neongate`, its established colors and six-name preset
    list. Account-derived aliases are retired by SPEC-035; do not promote account
    handles into preset branding.
